## Development & Dockerization Log

### Initial Implementation
- Implemented modular pipeline for:
  - Speech-to-text (OpenAI Whisper)
  - Intent extraction (spaCy)
  - Text-to-speech (pyttsx3)
  - OCR (Tesseract via pytesseract)
  - Unified CLI orchestrator (Typer)
- Created sample input files for audio, image, and text.
- Verified all core modules work natively via CLI.

### Dockerization
- Wrote a Dockerfile to:
  - Use Python 3.9-slim as base
  - Install system dependencies: tesseract-ocr, espeak, ffmpeg, build-essential, git
  - Copy the entire project into the container
  - Install all Python requirements for each module
  - Download spaCy model `en_core_web_sm` inside the image
  - Set the CLI orchestrator as the entrypoint
- Added echo log statements to Dockerfile for clear build progress.
- Moved Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to project root for correct build context and volume mounting.
- Updated requirements to install OpenAI Whisper from GitHub (not PyPI) for correct transcription engine.
- Fixed build errors by ensuring all system and Python dependencies are present (notably: build-essential for spaCy, git for Whisper).
- Successfully built and ran the container, confirming:
  - Audio transcription, intent extraction, and output writing all work in Docker.
  - All logs and outputs are visible and correct.

### Testing & Validation
- Ran the pipeline on sample audio, image, and text files both natively and in Docker.
- Confirmed outputs are written to the correct mounted volumes.
- Ensured all major requirements from instructions.md are met (see checklist above).

### Known Gaps / Next Steps
- Field mapping for OCR (currently only raw text extraction)
- More robust unit tests for all modules
- Expanded use of config.yaml for runtime configuration
- Optional HTTP API (FastAPI)
- Ongoing task tracking in TASKS.md
